# PTS3D
# In development
A basic raytracer implemented in C++.
# Notice
This will be based on the 'Raytracing in a weekend' tutorial. Already got it working, and this will be a really clean OOP, realtime implementation of it. It will be optimized, so it can be used in all kinds of other projects, engines etc.
